export const LEASE_TRANSCRIPT = `Broker: Hi Michael, thanks for jumping on. I'm calling on behalf of TechStart Innovations — they want to lease the 10th floor at 500 Park Avenue, about 8,500 square feet.

Landlord: Yeah, that space is available. What's their timing?

Broker: They want to be in by June 1st, so commencement June 1st. Looking at a 7-year term — that's 84 months.

Landlord: We're asking $45 per square foot annually on a modified gross basis. That comes out to roughly $28,000 a month.

Broker: They'll need 3 months free rent for the buildout disruption.

Landlord: I can do 3 months free. TI allowance is $35 per square foot.

Broker: Works for them. Annual escalations?

Landlord: 3.5% per year.

Broker: Security deposit — 2 months base rent, so $56,000?

Landlord: Correct. Inspection period is 45 days from LOI execution. LOI expires in 14 days from today.

Broker: Noted. Tenant entity is TechStart Innovations LLC, Delaware LLC. Landlord side is Park Avenue Properties Group, New York REIT?

Landlord: That's right.

Broker: Two asks from my client — right of first refusal on the 11th floor, and building directory signage.

Landlord: ROFR on 11 is fine. Directory signage yes, no exterior.

Broker: Perfect. Commission is 4.5% paid by landlord. Each party handles their own legal?

Landlord: Agreed. Send the LOI over.

Broker: Will do. My contact info — Sarah Chen, Manhattan Commercial Realty, sarah.chen@mcr.com, (212) 555-0123.`;

export const PURCHASE_TRANSCRIPT = `Broker: Good morning Bob. I'm representing Westfield Capital Partners on the acquisition of 1250 Commerce Drive in Dallas — the 22,000 square foot industrial flex building.

Seller: Morning. What are they offering?

Broker: They're coming in at $4.2 million all cash, no financing contingency.

Seller: We need at least $4.35 million. We've had other interest.

Broker: I'll bring it back to them but they're firm on $4.2M based on recent comps. They want a 30-day due diligence period and close by March 28th.

Seller: 30 days due diligence works. I can meet them at $4.2M if we close by March 28th, clean.

Broker: Deal. They'll need standard inspection and Phase I environmental as contingencies.

Seller: Fine. The building is already vacant so no tenant issues.

Broker: Great. On closing costs — title insurance is buyer's?

Seller: Yes, buyer covers title. Legal fees each party handles their own.

Broker: Commission is 5%, seller pays, split between both brokers.

Seller: Agreed. Who's the buyer entity?

Broker: Westfield Capital Partners LLC, Texas LLC. My client contact is James Hargrove, james@westfieldcap.com.

Seller: Seller entity is Commerce Drive Holdings Inc. LOI expires in 10 days?

Broker: 10 days works. One additional term — property delivered free and clear, and buyer wants right to assign the contract to an affiliate.

Seller: Delivery free and clear is no issue. Assignment to affiliate only, no third parties.

Broker: Agreed. I'll get the LOI drafted today.`;
